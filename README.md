# VOLMAP Viewer

![VOLMAP Viewer Teaser](teaser.png)

**VOLMAP Viewer** is a **web-based** tool for the visual assessment and analysis of **maps** between **tetrahedral meshes**.  
Users can load models directly in the browser and manage them with data structures optimized for interactive visualization.
You can display and interact in real-time with both source and target domains, check map validity, and compute map quality according to a variety of popular distortion metrics.

## Features

[to update...]

## Setup and Launch

This project can be used **without build tools or external dependencies**, but due to browser's CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and file access restrictions, it must be launched through a **local server**.

Below are three easy ways to start a local server: **Node.js**, **Python**, or **VS Code Live Server**.

### üü¢ Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed, run:

```bash
npx serve
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

### üêç Using Python

If you have Python installed, you can run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

### üí° Using VS Code Live Server Extension

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code (by Ritwick Dey).
2. Open your project folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and click **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. The app will open automatically in your browser at a local address (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).
